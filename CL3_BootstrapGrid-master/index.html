           <p><p>"Up dere," said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and keeping it there very solemnly.</p>

<p>"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you are dead? But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets? Main-top, eh?"</p>

<p>"Didn't say dat t'all," said Fleece, again in the sulks.</p>

<p>"You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see where your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don't get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It's a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go. But none of us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t'other a'top of your heart, when I'm giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?&mdash;that's your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!&mdash;that's it&mdash;now you have it. Hold it there now, and pay attention."</p>

<p>"All 'dention," said the old black, with both hands placed as desired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time.</p>

          <h2>Project 3</h2>
          <p>It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust was hot and pungent.  And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to add to the confusion.</p>

<p>Two men came past them.  Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy bundle and weeping.  A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my brother's threat.</p>

<p>So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent in between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded forms, grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past, and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>"Go on!  Go on!" cried the voices.  "Way!  Way!"</p>

      <h3>Three unequal columns</h3>
      <p>Get three columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong> of various widths. Remember, grid columns should add up to twelve for a single horizontal block. More than that, and columns start stacking no matter the viewport.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3">.col-md-3</div>
        <div class="col-md-6">.col-md-6</div>

      <h3>Full width, single column</h3>
      <p class="text-warning">No grid classes are necessary for full-width elements.</p>

      <hr>

      <h3>Two columns with two nested columns</h3>
      <p>Per the documentation, nesting is easy—just put a row of columns within an existing column. This gives you two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>, with another two (equal widths) within the larger column.</p>
      <p>At mobile device sizes, tablets and down, these columns and their nested columns will stack.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          .col-md-8

      <h3>Mixed: mobile and desktop</h3>
      <p>The Bootstrap 3 grid system has four tiers of classes: xs (phones), sm (tablets), md (desktops), and lg (larger desktops). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>
      <p>Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for xs and sm, you only need to specify xs.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">.col-xs-12 .col-md-8</div>
